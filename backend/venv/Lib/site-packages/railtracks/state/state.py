    2. It allows you to invoke the graph at a given node and will handle the execution of the graph.
    3. It will handle all the exceptions that are thrown during the execution of the graph.
    4. It will handle the creation of new requests and the management of the state of the nodes.
    5. It will save all the details in the object so that you can access them later.
    6. Simple logging of action completed in the system.

    The object is designed to be a large state object that contains all important details about the running of the
    system during execution. It can be accessed after run, to collect important details that will aid debugging and
